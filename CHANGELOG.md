# Changelog

All notable changes to the npm package and the crate, which share a version.
Wire protocol versions are tracked in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First release. Protocol v1.

**Server** (`tauri()`):
- `POST /tauri/authorize`: a database-checked session, an origin allowlist,
  single-use codes bound to PKCE S256.
- `POST /tauri/token`: atomic consumption, constant-time checks, and session
  creation in the app's request, so host hooks can reject or tag the session.

**Hand-off page** (`tauriProxyClient()`):
- request capture with URL cleanup
- the `redirect_uri` loopback allowlist
- `handoff()` and `cancelLink()`

**Webview** (`/client`):
- `tauriFetch`, a request bridge that adds the token in Rust
- `withTauri()`, which disables JS redirects and refreshes the session
- `asTauriClient()` tokenless types
- typed commands and events

**Rust plugin:**
- deep link, loopback and paste transports, with `Auto` selection
- the `SessionController`: generations and serialized commits
- an OS keychain store with a revision-matched profile and tombstones
- the auth bridge allowlist with response projections
- rustls with the OS certificate verifier, no redirects

**Platforms:** macOS, Windows and Linux.
